This is a <a href="https://www.codementor.io/projects/rss-feed-reader-website-atx32j280x" target="_blank">codementor project</a>.

## My Goals and what I've practiced

The main goal here was to create a simple and clean React app with a good visual experience. This was my first project using Tailwind and I have enjoyed a lot, it really helped me to get good results spending less time on CSS.

Working on this project also gave me the oportunity to study RSS standards.

Any feedback will be appreciated :)
